My portfolio Site was built using HTML, CSS & Vanilla JavaScript. My learning was focused on using tools readily available to create an attractive site.

## Optimizations

When I improve on this project, I will add my more recent personal projects and client work. I will also like to add some gifs to the front page to enable viewers see the project without clicking the links

## Lessons Learned:

No matter how small, we learn everyday. Through this project, I was able to learn how to integrate JavaScript to the buttons and most important seperation how everything comes together in the differnt stages of design

## Examples:
Take a look at these couple examples that I have in my own portfolio:
